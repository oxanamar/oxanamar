## Hi there 👋🏻  I'm Oksana

I'm a Frontend Developer with a background in technical support and web localization. My journey into the IT world began when I was living in Shanghai, China 🇨🇳 With over 3 years of experience in technical support, I've developed strong problem-solving skills and a passion for technology 👩🏼‍💻
In 2023, I decided to dive into coding and discovered my love for web development. I'm continuously learning and building projects to hone my skills.

## 💻 What I Do

- **Frontend Development:** I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm currently learning React.
- **Technical Support:** I have extensive experience in providing technical assistance and ensuring smooth operations for users.
- **Web Localization:** I've worked on projects that required adapting content for different markets and languages.
